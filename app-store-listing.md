Routines365 helps you build a daily routine that actually sticks. No complicated systems, no overwhelming dashboards — just a simple daily checklist that turns consistency into a habit.

HOW IT WORKS

Mark your most important habits as "Core." Complete them all and you earn a green day. String green days together and you build streaks. Watch consistency compound over weeks and months.

It takes about 10 seconds. Open the app, check off what you did, close it. Done.

YOUR DAILY CHECKLIST
• Choose from 75+ habits across morning, fitness, nutrition, recovery, mindfulness, and more — or create your own
• Core vs. Bonus habits — focus on what truly matters
• Day-of-week scheduling — set habits for M/W/F, weekdays only, or any custom schedule
• One-tap check off with haptic feedback
• Activity logging for steps, workouts, sauna, cold plunge, sleep, and more

GUIDED JOURNAL
Write your way. Choose between guided prompts (Gratitude, Daily Intention, and Reflection) or free write mode. Routines365 remembers your preference — zero friction. Saving an entry automatically marks your journal habit complete for the day, or just check it off if you journal in a physical notebook.

BREATHWORK & MOVEMENT
Guided breathing sessions — Box Breathing, 4-7-8, Wim Hof, Physiological Sigh, and Energizing Breath — with Om audio tones and visual pacing. Plus Qigong routines (Foundations and Eight Brocades) with step-by-step timers.

STREAKS, TROPHIES & QUESTS
Build daily streaks with milestones at 7, 14, 30, 50, 100, and 365 days. Earn trophies for achievements. Complete weekly quests to push your limits. Rest days protect your streak without guilt.

APPLE HEALTH INTEGRATION
Connect your Apple Watch, Oura Ring, or Garmin. See sleep duration, HRV trends, resting heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, and steps — all on your Today page. Habits auto-complete when your health data meets your goals (walked 10k steps? Done).

ACCOUNTABILITY PARTNER
Invite a friend and track each other's progress. Send cheers when they hit milestones. Stay motivated together.

FOCUS TIMER
Pomodoro-style focus sessions to protect your deep work. Track completed sessions alongside your habits.

PROGRESS & INSIGHTS
Beautiful progress calendar that fills with green as you stay consistent. Sleep stage breakdowns (Deep, Core, REM) with 7-night trends. Day-of-week patterns, streak analytics, and personalized insights that get smarter over time.

PREMIUM FEATURES
Start with a 7-day free trial. Unlock biometric insights (HRV and resting heart rate analysis), health auto-complete, unlimited habits, sleep stage charts, detailed reports, custom themes, share cards, and unlimited streak freezes.

$3.99/month or $29.99/year (37% savings).

BUILT FOR PRIVACY
Your data stays on your device and in your private account. No ads. No data selling. No social pressure. Just you and your habits.

## App Review Notes

This is a habit tracking app with optional HealthKit integration. Core functionality requires an account (email + password or magic link).

**Demo account:**
Email: review@routines365.com
Password: [SET THIS UP BEFORE SUBMISSION]

The app reads HealthKit data (steps, sleep, HRV, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2) — read-only and optional. HealthKit permission is requested only when the user taps "Connect Apple Health" in Settings.

Breathwork exercises use audio (Om drone) which plays during guided sessions. The app respects silent mode.

Premium subscription can be tested via the promo code system: go to Settings → Upgrade to Pro → "Have a code?" and enter a valid code. Contact Routines365.app@gmail.com if needed.

In-app purchases use StoreKit 2. Subscription prices: $3.99/month or $29.99/year, both with a 7-day free trial configured in App Store Connect.

Journal entries are stored server-side in Supabase (encrypted at rest). No journal content is shared or analyzed.
